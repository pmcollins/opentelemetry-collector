# Filter Processor

Supported pipeline types: metrics

The filter processor can be configured to include or exclude metrics based on
metric name. Please refer to [config.go](./config.go) for the
config spec.

It takes a pipeline type, of which only `metrics` is supported, followed by an
action:
- `include`: Any names NOT matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline
- `exclude`: Any names matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline

For the actions the following parameters are required:
 - `match_type`: strict|regexp|expr
 - `metric_names`: (only for a `match_type` of 'strict' or 'regexp') list of strings or re2 regex patterns
 - `expressions`: (only for a `match_type` of 'expr') list of expr expressions (see "Using an 'expr' match_type" below)

More details can found at [include/exclude metrics](../README.md#includeexclude-metrics).

Examples:

```yaml
processors:
  filter/1:
    metrics:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        metric_names:
        - prefix/.*
        - prefix_.*
      exclude:
        match_type: strict
        metric_names:
        - hello_world
        - hello/world
```

Refer to the config files in [testdata](./testdata) for detailed
examples on using the processor.

### Using an 'expr' match_type

In addition to matching metric names with the 'strict' or 'regexp' match types, the filter processor
supports matching entire `Metric`s using the [expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) expression engine.

The expr filter evaluates the supplied boolean expressions _per datapoint_ on a metric, and returns a result
for the entire metric. If any datapoint evaluate to true, then the entire metric evaluates to true, otherwise
the metric evaluates to false.

Made available to the expression environment are the following:

* `MetricName`
    a variable containing the current Metric's name
* `Label(name)`
    a function that takes a label name string as an argument and returns a string: the value of a label with that
    name if one exists, or ""
* `HasLabel(name)`
    a function that takes a label name string as an argument and returns a boolean: true if the datapoint has a label
    with that name, false otherwise

Example:

```yaml
processors:
  filter/1:
    metrics:
      exclude:
        match_type: expr
        expressions:
        - MetricName == "my.metric" && Label("my_label") == "abc123"
```

The above config will filter out any Metric that both has the name "my.metric" and has at least one datapoint
with a label of `my_label="abc123"`.
